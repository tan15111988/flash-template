Loading Movies Part one:

This is a basic example of loading mutiple .swf files into 
Movie Clip instances.

There are 4 .fla files and 4 .swf files (authored in Flash MX - Windows)

MainMovie.fla:
This is the base movie that you load your other files into.
It has 3 Movie Clip instances named mc_holder1 mc_holder2 mc_holder3.

The following actionscript on Frame 1 loads "Movie1.swf" into the 
into the Movie Clip instance called mc_holder1.

loadMovie("Movie1.swf","mc_holder1");

Movie1.fla:
Movie2.fla:
Movie3.fla:

These are just simple text and animation to give a visual view
of what is being done.

To test the movie just open MainMovie.swf in Flash.
To find out how it is done look at the .fla files.
